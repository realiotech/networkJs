# Proto

Protobuf files used to generate cosmos/realionetwork transactions.

## Local generation

Requirements:

- `brew install protoc`
- `npm install -g protoc-gen-ts` 

### Note
There seems to be a problem with typescript ~4.8.x and `protoc-gen-ts`.
`protoc-gen-ts` lists the dependency with the semantic version of `"^4.3.4"`, and
upon getting the version 4.8.x installed, the compiler was failing.
On typescript `4.3.4` it works which is the quick solution for now.


To generate the protobuf files on linux instead of OSX, remove the empty string after `sed -i ''`

```sh
./scripts/get_proto_files.sh
./scripts/create_proto_files.sh
./scripts/remove_grpc.sh
./scripts/remove_unused_dependencies.sh
```

## Note

The lib `@grpc/grpc-js` was not included in the `package.json`, and all the services were manually removed from the autogenerated proto files to avoid having that dependency.
This lib is just a tool to create the transactions, not to interact with a GRPC server, if you need the complete proto file you can locally run `./scripts/get_proto_files.sh` and `./scripts/create_proto_files.sh`
